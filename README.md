The project is a piano tuner that uses an Arduino module to indicate how out of tune a guitar string is. The module consists of three main components: an electret condenser microphone, an LED display, and an LED ring. When a button is pressed, the program analyzes the signal from the microphone and sets a predefined target string based on which guitar string is being played. A band-pass filter is then applied around the target frequency to remove unnecessary noise. The system calculates the tuning error and displays both the target string and the error on the LED screen. The LED ring provides a visual indication of the error, making the tuner easier to use from a distance.
